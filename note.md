### To do list 

1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Test for both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities, ensuring that user input is properly sanitized and encoded to prevent malicious script execution.

2. SQL Injection (SQLi): Check for SQLi vulnerabilities where untrusted user input is used in database queries. Test for various types of SQL injection, such as UNION-based, error-based, and blind SQLi.

3. Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI): Assess the application for LFI and RFI vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to include and execute malicious files or disclose sensitive information.

4. Host Header Injection: Test for host header injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker can manipulate the host header to perform various attacks like session fixation, cache poisoning, or server-side request forgery (SSRF).

5. Web Cache Poisoning: Assess if the application's caching mechanisms are properly implemented to prevent cache poisoning attacks, where an attacker can manipulate cached content to serve malicious or unauthorized data.

6. Directory Listing: Check if directory listing is enabled, as it may disclose sensitive information or provide an entry point for further attacks.

7. Authentication and Session Management: Evaluate the application's authentication mechanisms, including password strength, session management, and potential vulnerabilities like session fixation, session hijacking, or session timeout issues.

8. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Test if the application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on their behalf.

9. File Upload: Assess how the application handles file uploads, checking for potential vulnerabilities such as allowing the execution of malicious files or bypassing file type restrictions.

10. Information Disclosure: Look for any instances of sensitive information disclosure, such as error messages, debug information, or server configuration details, which could aid attackers in their exploitation attempts.
