Notes for Pentesters: File Upload Bypass Techniques

1.Double Extension:
File upload systems often rely on file extensions to determine the file type. By appending a second extension to the file, such as "shell.php.png" or "shell.php.jpeg,"
you can trick the system into treating the file as an image rather than a PHP file.

2.MIME Type Modification:
File upload systems also check the MIME type of the uploaded file. You can modify the file's content type header to deceive the system. For example, you can set the content
type to "image/png" even if the file is not a valid PNG image. This can bypass restrictions that only allow certain file types.

3.Null Byte:
Some systems use null bytes (\x00) to terminate the filename and determine the file type. By appending a null byte to the filename, you can make the system interpret the file 
extension differently. For instance, "shell.php%00.png" can bypass filters looking for PHP files.
